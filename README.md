## Overview

This project is a solution of Frontend Mentor's HTML CSS QR Code challenge. I have personalised it to redirect the user to my GitHub profile on scanning the QR Code. The QR code itself is custom made.
I have used Flaticons for most of the graphics, and the design resources of the Frontend Mentor challenge for this project.

## My process

Initially I worked to only solve the challenge as the specified design. Eventually, during the process I learned a lot and I ended up personalising the website. The colours are still same/inspired by the original designs, but the QR code and text have been customised. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Revision of Flexbox and general HTML boilerplate code.
- Alignment of Flexbox
- Box Shadow


### Continued development

Flexbox
